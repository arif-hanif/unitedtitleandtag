## What is needed to title a used car?

**Proof of ownership** - The vehicle's current title has to be properly assigned to you.  If the title was issued in Maryland, it can be used as your application for titling and registering the vehicle. If the vehicle is from a state that does not issue a title as proof of ownership, a registration document and a bill of sale may be submitted as proof of ownership.

**Application form** - If the vehicle's current title was issued in Maryland, use it as your application form by completing the section entitled Application for Title and Registration. If not or the current title has been written on, applicant must use (form VR-005) application for certificate of title. Be sure to include vehicle insurance information! (Tags will not be issued without verified insurance information!)

**Proof of purchase price** - This should be a bill of sale signed by both the buyer(s) and seller(s).  The bill of sale must be notarized if the following conditions apply:

- the vehicle is less than 7 years old; and
- the purchase price is at least $500 below the book value; and
- the new owner (buyer) wants to base the excise tax calculation (6% of the vehicle's value) on the sale price rather than the book value.

**Odometer disclosure statement** - The odometer reading can be recorded and attested in the Assignment of Ownership section on the Maryland title. You also can submit the MVA's odometer disclosure statement(form #VR-197).

**Maryland Safety Inspection Certificate** - The Maryland State Police form certifies that your vehicle meets Maryland safety standards.  It is valid for up to 90 days from the date issued.

Under certain circumstances, additional information and/or forms may be required:

**Lien information** - If you borrowed money to buy the vehicle, the lien information may need to be recorded on the application.  The MVA form entitled security interest filing (form #VR-217) must be used if a second lien is placed against the title.

**Lien release** - If the existing title indicates that a lien was placed against it, you must submit a lien release.  For a vehicle that was titled in Maryland, this could be a properly completed and signed Maryland Security Interest Filing or a signed letter from the lien holder specifically identifying the vehicle and stating that the lien has been released.  If the vehicle is currently titled in another state, you may submit a signed letter of release from the lien holder or you may have the lien holder sign the title indicating that the lien has been released.

**Power of attorney** - If someone other than you, the new owner, is signing the titling forms, this document is required.
